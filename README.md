# Get Started

To get started, you might want to explore the project directory structure and the default configuration file. Working with this project in your **development** **environment** will not affect any production deployment or identity tokens.

To learn more before you start working with migrator-management-canister, see the following documentation available online:

- [Quick Start](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/deploy-locally)
- [SDK Developer Tools](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/install)
- [Motoko Programming Language Guide](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/motoko/main/motoko)
- [Motoko Language Quick Reference](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/motoko/main/language-manual)

If you want to start working on your project right away, you might want to try the following commands:

```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd migrator-management-canister/

# Start the local replica
dfx start --clean --background

# Deploy the ledger canister
sh ./commands/deploy_ledger.sh

# Deploy all canisters for development environment
sh ./commands/workflow/deploy.sh all develop

# Fabricate cycles for the backend canister
sh ./commands/fabricate_cycles.sh
```

## Deploying to a specific environment

If you want to run the project on a local replica, you can use the script in `commands/workflow/deploy.sh` as such:

```
sh ./commands/workflow/deploy.sh arg0 arg1
```

Where:

- `arg0` is the canister to deploy, can be ``, `all`, `frontend`, `backend`
- `arg1` is the network to deploy to, can be ``, `develop`, `production`

#### e.g: To deploy **all** canisters for **develop** environment:

```
sh ./commands/workflow/deploy.sh
```

or

```
sh ./commands/workflow/deploy.sh all local
```

#### e.g: To deploy **all** canisters for **production** environment:

```
sh ./commands/workflow/deploy.sh all production
```

This will start a local replica binded to `http://0.0.0.0:8000`, proxying API requests to the replica at port 8000.

### Note on frontend environment variables

If you are hosting frontend code somewhere without using DFX, you may need to make one of the following adjustments to ensure your project does not fetch the root key in production:

- set`DFX_NETWORK` to `ic` if you are using Webpack
- use your own preferred method to replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` in the autogenerated declarations
  - Setting `canisters -> {asset_canister_id} -> declarations -> env_override to a string` in `dfx.json` will replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` with the string in the autogenerated declarations
- Write your own `createActor` constructor
